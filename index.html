    <h2>The best items(non-weapons)</h2>
    <h3> Med Kit</h3>
    <div>
        <div>
            <p>

                Med Kits are good to carry, especially if you have a medallion.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are useful if you're taking storm damage or were stuck in a storm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rare but not too rare, can carry up to three, refills your entire health.
            </p>
            Definitely something you always want to carry with you if you can.
            <h3>Chug Jug</h3>
            <p>
                After a fight with a lot of damage taken, you can easily pop a Chug Jug and get full health and shield
                back.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem with this item is that you can't often use it while being contested.
            </p>
            The only mistake people make is using a Chug Jug for very little health and wasting it.
            <p>
                It's super rare and takes forever to drink, but it is the the second or first best healing item.
            <h3>Mini Shield Potion</h3>
            </p>

            <p>

                The fact that you can carry around six of them and they take less time to drink makes these overall
                better
                than the big shield sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although they only go up to 50, It's the best and quickest way to gain shield when you're fighting an
                opponent
            </p>
            <h3>Big Shield Potion</h3>
            <p>
                Essential for fighting a sweat. To have a good chance of winning a fight you need full health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comes in three, gives the same amount of shield as minis(50 each) so minis and Big Pots pair well.
            <p>
            <h3>Slurp Juice</h3>
            <p>
                Slurp Juices are a perfect way to gain back everything while you're in battle, and you can usually use a
                Slurp Juice in time.
            </p>
            <p>
                It takes three seconds, while the Chug Jug take 15 seconds, so in my opinion it is the best healing
                item.
            </p>
            <h3>Grappler</h3>
            <p>
                Grapplers are effective for many reasons, like rotations and getting away from players.
            </p>
            <p>

                You can use them to gain high ground or get on top of buildings or builds.
            </p>
            <h3>Shockwave Grenade</h3>
            <p>
                Sends you flying when you throw it at the ground. Comes in six and is good for getting out of a fight.
            </p>
            <h3>Jetpack</h3>
            <p>
                The newest jetpack you can boost on and off which can make you go super far within a few seconds.
            </p>
            <h3>Boogie Bomb</h3>
            <p>

                Boogies are a cool item not necessary but good for funny clips.
            </p>
            <h3>Launch Pad</h3>
            <p>
                Good for rotations and to get out of storm.
            </p>
